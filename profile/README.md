<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, We are RobotDeğilim</h1>

## Who Are We?
RobotDeğilim is a ME462 group (2023 spring semester) that came together for the purpose of maintaining the code infrastructure that both next and current ME461-ME462 students will be using. 

## Project Definiton 
This project involves implementing a classic Space Invaders-inspired game using FPGA boards. The game features an engaging gameplay environment where players control a central spaceship to defend against incoming enemies. The primary screen is constructed using the VGA interface with a resolution of 640 x 480.

**##Gameplay Mechanics**
**-Spaceship Control:** Players control a central spaceship that can rotate and fire projectiles.
**Enemy Waves**: Enemies appear from the boundaries of the field and approach the spaceship deliberately.
**Objective**: Destroy incoming enemies before they breach your defenses. If enemies get past your fortifications, the game is over.
**##Key Features**
**VGA Interface:** The primary game screen is displayed using the VGA interface at a resolution of 640 x 480.
**Rotating Spaceship:** The spaceship can rotate, allowing players to strategically aim and fire at enemies.
**Projectile Firing**: Players can fire projectiles to destroy approaching enemies.
**Strategic Maneuvering:** Players must maneuver strategically to defend against enemy waves.
